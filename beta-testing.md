# CS30 Major Project Testing Feedback
## Developer
### Constructive Criticism
- Bug: When attempting to pick up a cube, instead another on-screen cube is picked up.
  - This may have to do with the system that prevents you from picking up cubes w/ other cubes on top of them?
- Bug: When tabbing out and pressing the windows key to Mess Around, managed to despawn all the cubes? not something that would happen in normal gameplay obviously
- Section 2 is only beatable by jumping off a cube then picking it up (As far as I could tell), which also allows the section to be beaten with one less cube than what's provided
- Mouse cursor moves freely until screen is first clicked, after which camera works as intended

### Not-Very-Constructive Feedback
- As a proof-of-concept, this was very good! Obviously there's not much in terms of levels rn, but I like the basic mechanics, it looks nice, movement is good, etc.
- Game wasn't easy enough to softlock and i really tried. please design it worse next time

## Non-developer
* One friend couldn't get up onto the second platform in the level -- most likely due to lower-end hardware and delta math, see https://bsky.app/profile/mixolumia.com/post/3lr5hhwetl22l
* the perspective is kinda wonky. Being in a blank textureless 3d space with no shadows makes thinks look kinda funky
* when I tried to place a block in the clear block the clear block was hovering above the ground
* and maybe some colour would be nice to help differentiate what I'm looking at
