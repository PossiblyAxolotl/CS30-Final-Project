# CS30 Major Project

## Description
A simplistic first-person puzzle game, reminiscent of the likes of [Antichamber](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/Antichamber/) and [Manifold Garden](https://williamchyr.itch.io/manifoldgarden)

## Needs To Have
* First person controller / movement ✅
* Object interaction ✅
    * Pick up / put down -- needs to only do one at a time ✅
    * Push buttons ✅
* Objects to interact with
    * Cube (grab & place) ✅
    * Cube button ✅
    * Push-button (press E to interact) ✅
* Enterance ✅ and exit ✅
* Doors (open & close with specific buttons)✅
* Load levels from file ✅
    * 3 total (1 tutorial, 1 larger introduction to elements, 1 "final test") ❌
* Background music & sfx ❌

## Nice To Have
* Simple level editor
* Fractal / recursive environments
* Entropy boxes (inspired by [The Entropy Centre](https://www.theentropycentre.com/), move back in time when released)
* Complex level elements
* Ending sequence
    - Typical of these types of games is some sort of little programmatic visual thing, something interesting to look at that may not have a direct meaning (see [Manifold Garden's ending](https://youtu.be/WvsEa2nRCaM) or [Antichamber's](https://youtu.be/a6jGKLxIrjs))
